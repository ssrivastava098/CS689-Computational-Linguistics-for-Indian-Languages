But in an attempt to give more footage to his son, the story was so broken that the film stuck on Jackie's weak shoulders.\n","On the one hand, the spectacle, which often happens in different cities of the country, happens in no time.\n","Imran Hashmi has become a painter once again after Raj 2 and is stuck in his role, but Soha Sanjana's role is completely miss fit. The pre-release publicity of the film was promoted as a film based on the rain that happened in Mumbai, but unfortunately the director forgot about the rain in Imran Soha's love story.\n","I have never seen art in such a state.\n","This is also lacking in their dialogues.\n","Vikram Bhatt handed over the film to assistant Vishal Pandya and he was defeated. Vishal continued the story but could not keep the pace of the film so fast that the story could bind the audience to the end.\n","There is nothing new or special about the story.\n","Mohanish Bahl, who became a film director and judge in TV shows, was disappointed.\n","The public needs to be seen, but not the bulbs.\n","In the second half, the story takes a fast pace, then director Rumi Jaffari seems to be able to keep his grip on the film.\n","There is nothing special about this hot bachelor party that you can join in. Yes, if you are a fan of hot parties, the film will freeze you after the interval. Many of the dialogues of the film have double meaning, so after the interval the story is completely out of the hands of the director.\n","The director Sahab made the X Miss Sri Lanka Jacqueline the heroine and introduced Sanjay Dutt as the villain with the cinematic style of the role of the Ring Master, who is seen singing a song of a film over and over again.\n","Nirjan Ayangar has not been able to put the feelings into words.\n","The only problem is that the film is made on any subject in Bollywood, with the desire to make it big at the box office, and the current spice is added to it to determine where the story gets from. Some of the same is true of this film made on a budget of crores and about two famous and expensive stars of the industry Amitabh and Sanjay Dutt. Despite the excellent special effects and the poor script of the film, it does not match the audience's test.\n","If only the dialogue like Ser and Chhatak were to become a film period, then the words Kos, Mile, Kutta, Bighas would also be used.\n","The film has two evergreen Bollywood super hits named Sholay and Laghan's Kashkumar in the name of the story. If you are going to see this film, do not look for the story in it.\n","It seems that Ram Gopal Varma and his factory days are not going well.\n","The dialogue and influence and period-period\n","Gaurav Kapoor, who has made a name for himself on the small screen as a VJ, seems to be in the whole film. The director has given more footage to Parmeet Sethy and Govind Namdev, who looks like a 'Behara Govind'. As director Varun was unable to get the cast to work properly and to keep the story on track.\n","Rajveer and Megha Chatterjee were cast in the lead roles. Both proved to be unreliable actors in the field of acting. The scattered script and slow pace from above weakened the movie.\n","The only thing that can be said is that Megha had learned ABC acting before she faced the camera. Some of the recent heroes are Rajveer, who somehow managed to stand in front of the camera.\n","God hears her prayer and comes to fulfill her dreams as a Dube (Sourabh Shukla). This is where the story gets lost. The film cannot bind the audience anywhere due to the weak script and the light grip of the director.\n","Rahul - Varun's dialogues do not have the capacity to bind the audience.\n","The young director Vijay Lalwani tried to do his job well, but he himself got lost in the quest to give more footage to his dear friend Farhan on screen.\n","The director, after the interval, played the role of Dadaji, and producer Jawahar, who was so impressed with the film that the rest of the characters were drowning, the story became so confused that he could not handle it.\n","Later, his character is involved.\n","Despite the short story, the director could not bind the audience to the film.\n","Nothing in the movie for family class.\n","The pace of Priyadarshan's grip on comedy has now slowed. Until the intervals, he kept fitting a dozen and a half stars into the story, filling the hotel with water in the climax, not knowing why the stars ran unnecessarily.\n","The phenomenon of the extreme side.\n","Ran doesn't say anything new.\n","Every time he goes to court from jail, he sees the pain of not getting bail and the hope of not getting bail on his return.\n","Some questions in the film remain unanswered.\n","It would be nice if the director had had a workshop with the film's cast and cameraman a few days before the shooting. Before the interval, the story progresses at such a slow pace that the audience sitting in the hall begins to feel bored.\n","Some questions in the film remain unanswered.\n","The music of this film is weak in dance.\n","Bollywood has probably become a little bit more bold. The stories of movies that once circulated on college campuses have now started to reach schools and now become the mummies of 10th grade students and the daddies of 11th grade students.\n","The downside of this film is that the pace of the film is so slow that the audience starts to giggle.\n","The film is not supported by the poor dialogue except by the sluggish direction of Moussazar Aziz. The director seems to have forced the pair of characters such as Fizuol Lotus and Tara and Mohit to prolong the story unnecessarily.\n","The film has two great Bollywood and Hollywood celebrities, but it cannot be said that the director did better than them. Big B has appeared in such looks and roles many times before, so there was no big role in the part of any other actor who could do anything. Yes, R Madhavan has made his presence felt among the long-width crowd of stars.\n","This opportunity was lost within minutes of the film's start.\n","Each actor in the film is seen speaking his rotten dialogue in front of the camera. The hero Asim Merchant is a doctor in the film, but the doctor is less of a failure lover in the whole film. Asim's face is neither emotionally charged nor is he acting.\n","The director would have thought that the effect would be effective in scaring the audience, but the audience sitting in the theaters laughs.\n","Fardeen, who has been a bridegroom on screen in many previous films, is also seen in the entire film.\n","It is unfortunate that Rahul Gandhi's politics has influenced him to become a media sensation.\n","The film has been trying to cash in the controversy over North Indians in Maharashtra. But the weak director, except for the poor script, is the weakest aspect of the film. Many action scenes of the film hero Kamal Khan are laughable. If Kamal had given up being a good actor in this film, he would certainly have made an impactful film on this issue.\n","This is not the case in My Name Is Khan.\n","No miracles are expected from this film of Uday Chopra.\n","They have not been given the proper support by writers, artists and directors.\n","The film has unnecessary violence and many double - meaning dialogues that were not needed. Despite being senior actors like Boman Irani and Vinod Khanna, the director duo could not get a job from them.\n","Sohail Khan and Jackie were disappointed.\n","Amrit Chopra (Rajesh Khanna), who became the business tycoon in the film, appeared on screen with beautiful wife Beena (Sara Khan) every time. The film looks at Kaka's acting and his extremely weak dialogue delivery as if he didn't want to do this film.\n","It would be nice if Lena made a film on the fast-growing gambling grounds between Mumbai and small towns that had a message to society. Well, at the end of the story, the director's message is trying to prove gambling to be a bad and destructive game, but it is not understandable to the general audience because all the dialogue between Sir Ben Kingsley and Big B is in English.\n","There are few people in the industry who close their completed film in the box because of just one star.\n","There was nothing left for them.\n","And how the educated, intelligent, captains of the country and the region get ready to act by working on the narrative written on these beaten stories.\n","The director of the film adapted the characters in a number of ways but forgot to use them properly. It is not clear why a senior actor like Prem Chopra played such a baserpare.\n","It is on the same basis that they have said that Rahul Gandhi is beating the brunt of the opposition to racism.\n","Akshay Kumar was unable to do anything but make noise in the name of the comedy, while Sunil Shetty somehow played his role. Katrina looked innocent and innocent, but Samira Reddy remained a showpiece.\n","The film's musical score is averaged, despite the names Javed Akhtar and Pritam. Apart from Fardeen and Jenelia, no artist attracts.\n","Of course, young director Suparna Varma has chosen a new subject, but it is beyond the understanding to conceal the characters' confusion and unnecessary intervals and the identity of all the characters.\n","No one can make a good film with just money and a good audience. A living example of this is Blue, made on a budget of over Rs 100 crore.\n","Despite the three musicians being associated with the film, there is no song in the film that dares to climb the music lovers' shoes.\n","This time, the script is scattered across the country because of the fact that the story is about a dozen stars apart from these three.\n","The music camera from the director to the cameraman has a strong grip on the camera, despite the fact that the photography is simple and more than half of the film is shot in blue or dark.\n","If you have no other option to watch, you can watch this movie once.\n","I think he's in a hurry!\n","Vashnu did not even take any known heroines for Jackie, perhaps thinking that her son would not be left behind. In the 1970s and 1980s, the granddaughter of Manmohan Desai, who had made several superhit films starring Amitabh Bachchan, Vaishali Desai also started her career with this film.\n","Well, Priyanka has been a little bit bold.\n","If you try to find reason or something new in a film, it is difficult to spend time in the hall.\n","The illusion of seeing something new persists for a while.\n","This time the unshakable bet of eternity was unsuccessful.\n","The script is not a commercial and entertainment spicy, and the scriptwriter seems to be confused about finalising the climax of the film, so the last twenty minutes of the story seems to have been unnecessarily pushed forward.\n","Director, Shamit couldn 't finally explain why his film hero doesn 't get involved in the race to make himself a hero from scratch in the eyes of the boss. Shamit seems to have a good experience in the computer industry, but then more than half of the film is spent on explaining the tricks of selling a computer's sales service, profit, and selling a product to government companies.\n","He doesn 't look as stubborn as the last hero of the Infinite, Imran.\n","Unfortunately, there were fewer scenes in their accounts.\n","Despite the busy cast of Raja Murad, Vidya Sinha, Amita Nagia, no one could make an impact on the film. That is why the audience who came to see the film on Friday at the Ikka Duka theatres could be counted on their fingers.\n","The film is a bit of a mystery to pass the long kissing scenes of Akshay - Kareena with a U/A certificate by the censor. Amrita Arora, Kareena Kapoor and Hollywood star Dennis Richard, all have been heavily exposed. The dialogue of the film has been silenced, but despite this, many double meaning dialogues still remain in the film.\n","Many of these scenes seem to have been forced to blur before the interval.\n","It is not clear what constraint the superstar of his time had to sign this film. In this film, the beautiful 22-year-old Sara Khan has a great fight with her 70-year-old uncle.\n","Friends may think the end of the story at the death of the hero is a tragic end.\n","The film, which was released last year, shares many of the events of the film with the story of 1920. This is why the audience already knows something about the next scene in many places. The director has not left any effort to get the sex in the film.\n","David's script could have been a good comedy film if he had tightened it up. But due to poor direction and scattered script, the nearly two - hour film did not bind the audience to the end.\n","This is the naked truth of the misuse of a strong pillar of Lokanthan.\n","From this perspective, the second part of the myth is a terrifying experience.\n","The better use of cameras and latest technology has put this story in a different category from C - class horror films. Vathal Seth and Ayub Khan are the weakest link in the film.\n","The script of the film is extremely weak. The locker dialogue on it is the weak side of the delivery film.\n","The film may not be able to stand the test of the audience who had just entered the hall for the purpose of entertainment. A producer can destroy the story in his desire to show his maximum form on screen.\n","Anjana Sukhani has a few less acting and a few more sexy scenes.\n","The film follows the same drama that was once seen in films made in the 1970s and 80s. The short story follows Johnny Lever, who suddenly becomes a senior police officer, who makes strange moves whenever there is a pause.\n","The director of the film is also slightly more impressed by Sholay, only to show them in his film as hand-washing thieves on expensive cars. But shortly before the interval it becomes clear among the audience that Jai is the police inspector.\n","The film's lyrics are weak.\n","It would be better if the director developed the rest of the characters in the film rather than being too loyal to the producer.\n","There is nothing new in the story of the film. Especially, the first half is quite loose.\n","She got lost in the film, which was sadly between Salman and Ajay Devgn.\n","After the interval, when it is the time for the characters to identify themselves, the story begins to wander. Even in a film of less than two hours, the viewer cannot bind himself to the end.\n","Dino became a villain in the film\n","After the interval, the film becomes confused.\n","It would have been better if the director had focused on the mother - son relationship rather than the Sanskrit slang of the hero Ram on the roof of the house.\n","I walk out of the streets and I get stuck.\n","The climax also feels unnecessarily drawn.\n","We feel the impact of this perception, but we are not excited and motivated.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Open the file in write mode\n","with
